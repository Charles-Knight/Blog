My last post emphatically expressed my adoration for the Crowboard which I had recently built, and while the crowboard is a lovely keyboard, it had a couple of flaws that I found frustrating in daily use.

1. The Crowboard isn't wireless. I have several computers on my desk and I use them all via one keyboard. I need to be able to quickly change connections throughout the day.
2. It doesn't run ZMK. I really love configuring my boards with ZMK.
3. Micro USB. Need I say more in 2023?

With those issues in mind I set out to find a new board that retained the features I love about the Crowboard, while improving on the qualities that I found disagreeable. The board that I stumbled upon was the Zaphod.

Much like the Crowboard, the Zaphod is a split unibody keyboard, however the Zaphod has a built in MCU with bluetooth capablities and is designed to run ZMK (in fact the board is designed by the primary maintainer of ZMK!) Aditionally, the Zaphod is based on the Ferris Sweep keyboard which means that it has a more aggressive column stagger than the crowboard, which was more Corne like in its layout. Furthermore the Zaphod has choc-spaced keys meaning that the keys are more tightly spaced allowing for an even smaller keyboard, and in my opinion, a more aesthetically pleasing design.

The Zaphod as been a joy to type on. It has a more aggressive angle between the left and right half than the Crowboard allowing for a more natural and relaxed hand positioning while typing. Likewise, the ferris inspired column stagger has been a joy for my pinky fingers. I had long suspected that the Corne's stagger wasn't quite aggressive enough for my fingers and the Zaphod has confirmed it. The outermost column lines up nicely with my pinky finger's natural resting position and reaching for the top row no longer feels like such a stretch. The addition of bluetooth and the ability to connect to up to five devices has made switching between my various devices a simple keypress away. And the large display makes it easy to know what device I'm connected to, and what layer is currently active. I have bascially zero complaints. Having quickly displaced my Cornes, the Crowboard, and every other board in my house, the Zaphod seems to be the daily keyboard I've been waiting for.
